# Cats vs Dogs Dataset:
This repository contains the code and resources used for preprocessing and building a predictive model on the popular Cats vs Dogs dataset. The project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline, from raw data preparation to final predictions.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of cats and dogs using a machine learning model. The pipeline includes preprocessing raw images, data augmentation, and training a deep learning model to achieve high accuracy on unseen data.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Cats vs Dogs dataset, a publicly available dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs. It is downloaded and processed from Kaggle's Dogs vs Cats dataset.

Classes: Cats, Dogs

Dataset Size: 25,000 images

Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

# Modeling

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture consists of:

Convolutional Layers:

Extract spatial features from images.

Pooling Layers:

Reduce spatial dimensions to avoid overfitting.

Dense Layers:

Fully connected layers for classification.

Dropout:

Applied dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

**Model Training:** 

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy

Metrics: AccuracyModeling
